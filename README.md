Theme : Automation For Health

Description :
The basic idea of our project is related to common man problems, that they face during health related issues.
Currently if an individual falls sick then they have to be manually involved in each and every steps, eg:They have to look for
hospitals and they are in a dilemma which would be the best hospitals for them and sometimes cheaper too. 
Also they have to go and take tokens themselves and wait for quite a long time to get diagnosed. 
They then need the proper medication(medicine) which they have to take from severals medical store (if one doesnt get all the medicines
from a single shop).
They need the proper dosage and timings for medicine which they forget max of the time.



Solution:
List of suggested hospitals will be provided.
Automatic tokens will be generated for them for the selected hospitals.
Prior notifications for the appointments.
Dosage,their timings, and best medical store will be displayed on their resp. profile
